## **UI Design**

### Strategy 

The game was created for people of all ages to play.  The game was designed for entertainment purpose.

The main aim is to be able to know how to play the game andthe correct answer from a list of possible answers from the available list of options.   

### **Wireframes**

I created the structure of the game using balsamic to make the wireframes. The design was focused on desktop first and then responsive for all the other device.

#### Colors 

The following palette of colors were chosen as they were eye-catching, vibrant for the game and worked well together: 

1. (87.4deg, rgb(181, 151, 174) 1.9%, rgb(154, 128, 181) 49.7%, rgb(158, 112, 112) 100.5%) - for gradient background
2.rgb(232, 212, 226) - for text colour for the game name and the next button text. 
3. rgb(228, 230, 238) - for the container with the quiz components
4. rgb(140, 49, 226) - the next button background color.

6. rgb(42, 118, 42) - next button focus

##### Typography

* Throughout the site I used 'Poppins', sans-serif; as it is easy to read and I used Pacifico, Arial Helvetica for the quiz name and the next button text as it was very easy to read and stylish.
